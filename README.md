# My Tempory Website

> A quick mess around with nuxt to develop a holding page for my domain. 

## Build Setup

Set up with 2 heroku free tier apps in a pipeline, 

one auto deploys to dev.liambroadbent.com. the other deploys to master. 

I should develop any changes on local and check they work with npm run dev. 

If im happy with the local I can merge into dev to automatically push to test and checkout on my staging area dev.liambroadbent 

When I have all the features I want to go live with I push to master and heroku builds the site live.
